Code for models: functions of our proposed estimators weighted QE and MDE. Several examples of using the functions are included in the file. The code is revised based on the code from Mcgrath: https://github.com/stmcg/estmeansd/tree/master/R. 

To reproduce the results for the real-data example （meta-analysis on PHQ-9 scores）, data and R code for the analysis were provided in real_data folder.
